# zim.zsh
attempting to use zsh with ZIM framework

```
1. install ZIM framework : https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw.git
2. add autosuggestions and fasd modules at .zimrc file in ~ directory
3. modify syntax-highlighters tool setting, delete cursor syntax highlights to avoid confilct between autosuggestions and syntax-highlighter: 
zhighlighters=(main, brackets)
4. set prompt theme as 'eriner', and set prompt colours:
$ prompt eriner black white cyan yellow
Please note that here the colours were modified by solarized theme, therefore black, white and so on are not the nature colours.
